# 📖 Java with Projects – Repository Guide

Welcome to my **Java with Projects** repository! 🎉<br>  
This repository is based on the book **"Java with Projects"** by Dr. Sean Kennedy & Maaike van Putten.<br>  
Each chapter is organized as a **separate branch**, allowing for structured learning and version control. 🚀

🔹 Each **chapter** is stored in its own **branch**.<br>
